    		<h2>Web front-end development</h2>
			<p>
				Front end development is the process of creating web pages or apps and other front-end interfaces to present to users. Through HTML, CSS, 
			    JavaScript and various derived technologies, frameworks and solutions, the user interface interaction of Internet products can be realized. 
			    It evolves from web page making, and its name has obvious characteristics of the times. In the evolution process of the Internet, web page 
			    production is the product of Web1.0 era. The main content of early websites is static, mainly pictures and text, and users' behavior of using 
			    websites is mainly browsing. With the development of Internet technology and the application of HTML5 and CSS3, modern web pages are more 
			    beautiful, interactive and powerful. Mobile Internet has brought a large number of high-performance mobile terminal devices and fast wireless 
			    networks, HTML5, node.jS Various framework class libraries emerge one after another.
            </p>
			<h2>Development history</h2>
			<p>
			In the past, Photoshop and Dreamweaver were able to make web pages. With the increasing difficulty of website development and the diversity of 
			development methods, web page production is closer to the traditional website background development, and web page production is more called web 
			front-end development. The front-end technology includes four parts: front-end art, browser compatibility, CSS, HTML "traditional" technology 
			and adobe air, Google Gears, as well as strong conceptual interactive design, artistic visual design, etc.
			</p>
			<p>
			In the era of Web1.0, due to the limitation of network speed and terminal capacity, most websites can only present simple graphic information, 
			which can not meet the needs of users on the interface, and the requirements for interface technology are not high. With the improvement of 
			hardware, the emergence of high-performance browser and the popularity of broadband, technology can realize more possibilities in the user 
			experience, and the front-end technology field bursts into vigorous vitality.
			</p>
			<p>
			After 2005, the Internet has entered the era of Web2.0, and a large number of web applications similar to desktop software have sprung up. 
			Web page is no longer just carrying a single text and pictures, a variety of rich media make the content of the web page more vivid, and 
			the software interaction form on the web page provides users with a better use experience, all of which are based on the front-end technology.
			</p>

			Mastering html is the core of a web page. It is a standard language for making web pages and a language used by web browsers. It eliminates the 
			obstacles of information exchange between different computers. Therefore, it is the most widely used language on the network, and also the main 
			language to form web documents. Learning HTML well is the basic condition for web developers.
